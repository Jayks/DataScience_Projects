    "# Medical Image Data Format\n",
    "Medical images follow Digital Imaging and Communications (DICOM) as a standard solution for storing\n",
    "and exchanging medical image-data. The first version of this standard was released in 1985.\n",
    "Since then there are several changes made. This standard uses a file format and a communications protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Format — All patient medical images are saved in the DICOM file format. \n",
    "This format has PHI (protected health information) about the patient such as — name, sex, age in addition to \n",
    "other image related data such as equipment used to capture the image and some context to the medical treatment. \n",
    "Medical Imaging Equipments create DICOM files. Doctors use DICOM Viewers, computer software applications \n",
    "that can display DICOM images, read and to diagnose the findings in the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Communications Protocol — The DICOM communication protocol is used to search for imaging studies in the archive \n",
    "and restore imaging studies to the workstation in order to display it. \n",
    "All medical imaging applications that are connected to the hospital network use the DICOM protocol to \n",
    "exchange information, mainly DICOM images but also patient and procedure information. \n",
    "There are also more advanced network commands that are used to control and follow the treatment, schedule procedures, \n",
    "report statuses and share the workload between doctors and imaging devices."
